**Wny is it interesting to us?**
A majority of our members are quite passionate about video games. So, the chance to create our own game from scratch is quite excillarating. 

**What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use?**
We plan on using Python --we have already confirmed our selection with Professor Reem Ali. In addition to that, we're also deciding on which libraries to use. This may change as we proceed because upcoming functions will need various dependencies. But we will adequately document the process :)

**What will be the input/output of your project?**
We were thinking of a text-based game that is very similar to Mario's adventure games. We're still deciding on what the main goal of the game is 

.The main objective of the game is to get a high score on the number of monsters defeated. 
.In addition to that, as you kill monsters


**What are the features that the project provides?**

.The user can start or quit the game. Only one life -- we're thinking of distributing health potions throughout the map.
.The user will have to face various randomly generated monsters.
.The user will roll the pyramid dice (4 sides) and that will have the options!
.But as they kill monsters, 
.The user will also be given various choices that alter the way the rest of the game continues (could have 1-3 alternate endings).
