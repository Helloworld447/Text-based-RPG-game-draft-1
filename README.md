**Wny is it interesting to us?**
A majority of our members are quite passionate about video games. So, the chance to create our own game from scratch is quite excillarating. 

**What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use?**
We plan on using Python --we have already confirmed our selection with Professor Reem Ali. In addition to that, we're also deciding on which libraries to use. This may change as we proceed because upcoming functions will need various dependencies. But we will adequately document the process :)

**What will be the input/output of your project?**
We were thinking of a text-based game that is very similar to Mario's adventure games. We're still deciding on what the main goal of the game is 

.The main objective of the game is to get a high score on the number of monsters defeated. 
.In addition to that, as you kill monsters


**What are the features that the project provides?**

The idea is that the user plays a Paladin, a sworn protector of a small town called Amberwater. A corrupt sorcerer seeks to conquer the obsidian-rich hometown so that he can open a portal to the Nether. He does this so that he can return home; however, doing so will release unspeakable evil in Amberwater. So, our user must go through 7 levels, each with it's own quest,options, puzzles, and even monsters. Here's a rough idea of what we're thinking of implementing:

.Each level has unique story elements tied to the sorcerer's plans. And each level also introduces puzzles, monsters, and environmental challenges (maybe hail affecting specfic abilities, etc)

.Use of a 3-sided die: 
      Combat(attack, defend, special ability)
      Exploration(left, right, Secret)
      Puzzle outcomes( correct, partial, fail)
